This is not a replacement for the HomeAssistant Android app, it just adds more features to your phone, linked to HomeAssistant.

Here are the main areas I am working on:

- [x] Assist Satelite: A MaterialYou-themed assistant popup that uses the built-in STT and TTS APIs to make it faster and cheaper to use.
- [ ] Local Media Controls: In other words, use the Android media controls to control HomeAssistant media_player entities.
- [ ] Remote Media Controls: Use HomeAssistant to control media playing on your Android device.
- [ ] Widgets: A better set of widgets that are more fully featured (for example, a to-do list widget).
- [ ] Calendar Provider: Show events from HomeAssistant calendars in your phone's native calendar app.
- [ ] Buttons and Switches: Add more controls to control your Android device from HomeAssistant (including those that can be controlled with notification commands but do not have an entity).
